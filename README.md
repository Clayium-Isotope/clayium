# [WIP] Clayium for MC 1.12.2

## Introduction

Thank you for find this repository from many repositories on GitHub.  
We'll give you [Clayium] but for Minecraft 1.12.2!

We have only one problem.  
Our mod is not enough to play.  
We need your cooperations (issues, pull requests, etc...)!

## Why started making this secondary mod

I'm fond of [Clayium].

As you know, the original mod supports only Minecraft 1.7.10 and last updated at Dec 2016.  
I think a few people want new version Clayium.

## Last

I'm still learning English, communicating, and programming.  
I'm sorry for not being good at them.
